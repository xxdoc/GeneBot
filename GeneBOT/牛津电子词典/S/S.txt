NOTE ON USAGE 用法: Indefinite pronouns such as somebody, someone, everyone, no one, etc are singular and, grammatically, should be followed by othersingular pronouns (he, she, his, her, etc). *somebody、someone、 everyone、 no one等不定代词均为单数, 根据语法规则, 後面应该用其他单数代词（he、 she、 his、 her等）. Traditionally, if the sex of the person is unknown, the masculine pronouns he, him, his have been used to refer to both females and males 按照传统用法, 若性别不详则男女两性均用阳性代词he、 him、 his表示: Everybody has his own view of what happened. 对於所发生的事情, 各人有各人的看法. * Somebody has lost his car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. * Did anybody hurt himself? 有人受伤了吗? Many people today consider this shows sexual bias and try to avoid it. 如今很多人认为这种用法有性别偏见之嫌, 因而尽量加以避免. The preferred way, especially in speech, is to use they, them or their with a singular neutral meaning 较为可取的方法是使用they、 them或their, 并赋以单数的中性含义, 尤用於口语: Everyone said they would help. 大家都表示要帮忙. *  Either John or Jane has to give up their job. 不是约翰就是简, 总有一个得放弃工作. Another way, especially in writing, is to use(s)he, he or she, him or her, his or her, though some people find this clumsy 另一种方法尤见於书面形式, 是使用(s)he、 he or she、 him or her、 his or her, 但有些人认为过於累赘: Somebody has lost his or her car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. A third possibility is to rephrase the sentence to make the subject plural, thus avoiding the problem 第三种用法是修改句子, 使主语变为复数以避开这个问题: Did any of you hurt yourselves? 有人受伤了吗?

sell
NOTE ON USAGE 用法: Compare sell, vend, peddle, push and flog. 试比较sell、 vend、 peddle、 push、 flog这几个词.  1 Sell is the most general verb, meaning `give in exchange for money' *sell使用最广, 意为｀拿东西换钱＇: They are selling their house and moving to the country. 他们打算把房子卖掉, 搬到乡下去. * Do you sell magazines here? 你们这儿卖杂志吗?2 Vend is formal and indicates the selling of small articles. *vend较文, 指出售小件商品. The noun vendor is much more common than the verb 由这个动词派生出的名词vendor, 比其动词本身较为常用: a street vendor, a news-vendor 街上的摊贩、 报贩. It is also a legal term used especially in the selling of a house *vendor还是个法律术语, 用以指房产的卖方: The vendor signs a contract with the purchaser. 卖方须与买方签订契约. Vending-machine is also common and is a coin-operated slot machine for the sale of small items. *vending-machine也较常用, 是一种投币式出售小商品的自动售货机.  3 Peddle indicates the selling of small, inexpensive goods by going from house to house *peddle指挨门挨户地推销廉价的小商品: He peddled small household articles around the town. 他在城里挨家挨户兜售日用百货.  4 Push is informal and is used for the selling of illegal drugs *push是口语用词, 指出售违禁毒品: He was caught pushing heroin to schoolchildren. 他在向小学生贩卖海洛因时被捕.  5 Flog is slang. *flog是俚语用词. It often suggests that what is to be sold is of little value, possibly stolen and therefore difficult to sell 这个词常指出售的东西无甚价值, 或可为赃物, 故难以售出: He tried to flog me a broken TV set. 他一个劲儿向我兜售一个破电视机.

NOTE ON USAGE 用法: Indefinite pronouns such as somebody, someone, everyone, no one, etc are singular and, grammatically, should be followed by othersingular pronouns (he, she, his, her, etc). *somebody、someone、 everyone、 no one等不定代词均为单数, 根据语法规则, 後面应该用其他单数代词（he、 she、 his、 her等）. Traditionally, if the sex of the person is unknown, the masculine pronouns he, him, his have been used to refer to both females and males 按照传统用法, 若性别不详则男女两性均用阳性代词he、 him、 his表示: Everybody has his own view of what happened. 对於所发生的事情, 各人有各人的看法. * Somebody has lost his car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. * Did anybody hurt himself? 有人受伤了吗? Many people today consider this shows sexual bias and try to avoid it. 如今很多人认为这种用法有性别偏见之嫌, 因而尽量加以避免. The preferred way, especially in speech, is to use they, them or their with a singular neutral meaning 较为可取的方法是使用they、 them或their, 并赋以单数的中性含义, 尤用於口语: Everyone said they would help. 大家都表示要帮忙. *  Either John or Jane has to give up their job. 不是约翰就是简, 总有一个得放弃工作. Another way, especially in writing, is to use(s)he, he or she, him or her, his or her, though some people find this clumsy 另一种方法尤见於书面形式, 是使用(s)he、 he or she、 him or her、 his or her, 但有些人认为过於累赘: Somebody has lost his or her car keys. 有人把汽车钥匙丢了. A third possibility is to rephrase the sentence to make the subject plural, thus avoiding the problem 第三种用法是修改句子, 使主语变为复数以避开这个问题: Did any of you hurt yourselves? 有人受伤了吗? See also note on usage at he. 参见 he 词条的用法说明.
