NOTE ON USAGE 用法: When indicating possession, the most commonly used verb in British English is have got (in present tense forms) 在表示｀有＇的意思时, 英式英语中最常用的动词是have got（用现在时态）: `Have you got any pets?' `Yes, I've got three rabbits and a tortoise.' ｀你有什麽宠物吗?＇｀有, 我有三只兔子和一只乌龟.＇ In US English (and commonly in tenses other than the present in British English) have is used 在美式英语中, 用have表示｀有＇（在英式英语, have表示｀有＇时一般不用於现在时态, 但常用於其他时态）: I have an apartment in downtown Manhattan. 我在曼哈顿中心区有一套住房. *  I haven't got a car now but I'll have one next week. 我现在没有汽车, 但是下星期就能有一辆.
